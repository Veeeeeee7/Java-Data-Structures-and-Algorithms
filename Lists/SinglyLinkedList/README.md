#Singly Linked Lists

Singly Linked Lists are used only when the first index of a list is needed. These linked lists are created so that each node points to the next and the list only knows the head node. Since the list only knows the head node, it is only possible to add and remove the first node. This will result in constant time complexity, O(1).

Only use when first node is needed.
