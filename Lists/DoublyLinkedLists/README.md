# Doubly Linked Lists

It is linked list where each node points to the node before and after it. There is a head node, which points to null (before it) and the second node (after it), and a tail node, which points to null (after it) and the second to last node (before it). You can only change the front and the back of the list. Has constant time complexity O(1) when adding / removing from the head and tail.
