# Binary Search Algorithm

-   Standard Search Algorithm
    -   chooses the elements in the middle of the array and compares it with the target value
    -   if the element is greater than the target value, the algorithm searches the left half of the array
    -   if the element is less than the target value, the algorithm searches the right half of the array
-   data must be sorted (sort the array first)
-   time complexity: O(log n)
