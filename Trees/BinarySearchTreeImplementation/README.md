# Binary Search Tree

-   binary tree where the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater than the parent
    -   no duplicate nodes are allowed, unlike binary trees
-   made for easy searching using the binary search algorithm O(log n)
-   if you input sorted data (especially in decreasing order), you will get a linked list and binary search algorithm will be O(n)
    -   some algorithms will shift the nodes around to fix this
-   uses in-order traversal to get the data in sorted order
